  bio: [
    "I'm an aspiring UI/UX designer with a background in web development and a growing passion for creating intuitive, user-friendly digital experiences. After building websites as a junior developer, I became increasingly fascinated by the design sideâ€”how layout, color, and interaction affect the user journey.",
    'Over the past year, I&apos;ve been actively learning UI/UX principles through online courses, tutorials, and hands-on projects. I use tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and FigJam to create wireframes, prototypes, and responsive interfaces that prioritize usability and accessibility.',
    "I'm still early in my journey, but I'm committed to improving every day by building personal projects, learning from feedback, and staying inspired by the design community.",
    'Outside of design, I enjoy exploring new creative tools, experimenting with layouts and color schemes, and contributing to open-source or collaborative projects when I can.',
